Enos Mills

Naturalist, writer, and founder of Rocky Mountain National Park.

Mills met Muir when Mills was a young man and Muir was already an elder statesman; Mills was inspired to work for conservation and national parks largely because of Muir's influence.

Calling himself "the John Muir of the Rockies," Mills said, "I owe everything to Muir. If it hadn't been for him I would have been a mere gypsy." [Literary Digest, July 14, 1917]

Muir wrote to Mills in 1913: "I shall always feel good when I look your way: for you are making good on a noble career. I glory in your success as a writer and lecturer and in saving God's parks for the welfare of humanity. Good luck and long life to you."

Mills wrote to Muir in 1914, shortly before Muir's death: "I shall leave for Washington in a few days to help set things moving for the conservation of scenery.... 

As you well know, it is the work that you have done that has encouraged me... in the big work that I am planning to do. If you will push along another book or two these books will help the cause more than you can imagine."
